    "Python provides an alternative way to do map and filter operations, called a list comprehension. Many programmers find them easier to understand and write. List comprehensions are concise ways to create lists from other lists. The general syntax is:\n",

    "As with map, each item in the sequence is transformed into an item in the new list.\n",
    "Instead of the iteration happening automatically,\n",
    "however, we have adopted the syntax of the for loop which may make it easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as in a regular for loop, the part of the statement for value in things says to execute some code once for each item in things. Each time that code is executed, value is bound to one item from things. The code that is executed each time is the transformer expression, value * 2, rather than a block of code indented underneath the for statement. The other difference from a regular for loop is that each time the expression is evaluated, the resulting value is appended to a list. That happens automatically, without the programmer explicitly initializing an empty list or appending each item."
