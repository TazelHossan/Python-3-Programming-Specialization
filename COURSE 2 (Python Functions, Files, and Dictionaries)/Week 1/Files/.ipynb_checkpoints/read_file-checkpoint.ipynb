One is the string, that's the name of the file, wxPython.text. And the other says what to do with the file. In our case, R for reading. Later on, we'll see W for writing. The open function returns an object. It's a file object"

    "note: you might notice something a little strange here, which is that we get these blank lines. The reason for that is that each of the strings, you'll remember had that newline character at the end, which meant do a carriage return. The print function always does a a carriage return, and so we're getting two of those. One is starting us on a new line, and the other one is starting us on a new line again, so we get a blank line. What if we didn't want to have that extra blank line? Well, you've seen the dot strip method before. I can strip the whitespace from the beginning and ends of each of these lines, so the dot strip method gets rid of any whitespace at the beginning or the end."

      "wxPython was created when Robin Dunn needed a GUI to be deployed on HP-UX systems and also on Windows 3.1 within a few weeks. While evaluating commercial solutions, he ran across Python bindings for the wxWidgets toolkit. Thus, he learned Python and, in a short time, together with Harri Pasanen, became one of the main developers of wxPython, which grew from those initial bindings.\n",

Later versions were created with SWIG, greatly decreasing the amount of work to update the wrapper. The first \"modern\" version was announced in 1998.[1]\n",

Just like \"Classic\" wxPython, it wraps the wxWidgets C++ toolkit and provides access to the user interface portions of the wx API, enabling Python applications to have a graphical user interface on Windows, Mac or Unix systems with a native look and feel and requiring very little, if any, platform-specific code.[6]\n",
